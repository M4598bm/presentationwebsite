      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      Phonegap is a mobile application development framework. It allows developers to build applications for mobile platforms using CSS, HTML, and Javascript instead of platform specific APIâ€™s. In addition, your applications can utilize native device features such as device storage, geolocation, camera, and accelerometer without using the standard developing kits. The benefit of Phonegap is that it is an easy way to make simple applications that can be used for three main operating systems: Android, iOS, and Windows. Some drawbacks are that it is not widely used and therefore there is little support through online forums and little to no source code online to learn how to make advanced applications, and the documentation ends at changing some text on a blank page. It often gets mixed in with Apache Cordova, and nothing is standardized. But hopefully this tutorial will help to resolve some of these issues!

      <h2>Background</h2>
        Phonegap was developed in 2009 by Nitobi. In 2011, it was purchased by Adobe, which released an open source version called Apache Cordova. Apache Cordova now powers PhoneGap. The difference between the two is very simple. Cordova can be thought of as the server that Phonegap runs on.
